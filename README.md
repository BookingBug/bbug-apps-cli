# jrni-cli

## Installation

Requires node 10. See [Downloading and installing Nodejs and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

```npm install -g @jrni/jrni-cli```

If you see permission errors when trying to install see [Resolving EACCES permissions errors when installing packages globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally)

## Options

Options may be passed with flags, however you will be prompted to enter any missing required
options.

The options will be stored in the project directory in ```.bbugrc```. This avoids the need to
re-enter options upon re-triggering commands for a given app project.

## Versions of the cli vs server versions

In version version5.17 of the JRNI engine, a new parameter was added to the api upon install of an extensibility application. It optionally allows you to keep the configuration of the application. This feature was added to v5.17+ of the JRNI BE engine and v0.1.2 of the cli.

In short if the version of the engine is below 5.17 use v0.1.0 of the cli. If above 5.17 use v0.1.2+.
